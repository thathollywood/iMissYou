Capacitance-triggered PUSH notification for Arduino YUN

My entry for the [Arduino Uno WiFi XMAS Contest 2015](http://www.arduino.org/arduino-xmas-2015)

**What is it?**

A Peer2Peer Photoframe that when touched, communicates with a Service that sends a PUSH notification to a phone: ‘I’m thinking of you’.
This MVP was developed with the Arduino Yun, a capacitive layer (behind the photo), and the Pushover notification service.


**Result?**

Brings together loved ones separated by distance in a tactile way.

I touch the faces on my family’s photo - Instantly, anywhere in the world, they know I’m thinking of them.


**HARDWARE**

* [Arduino YUN](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun)
* 2 LEDs for Status: Online/Ready & Sending (I soldered these to a test rig).
* Conductive material to create capactive 'aerial'. I used cardboard and Bare Conductive's [Electric Paint](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/electric-paint-50ml/)
* Assorted wires
* [Pushover account](https://pushover.net) for notifications.
